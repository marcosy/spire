# Server plugin: UpstreamCA "disk"

The `disk` plugin loads root CA credentials from disk, using them to generate
intermediate signing certificates for the server's signing authority. The
intermediate certificates are minted against CSRs generated by the ServerCA
plugin.

The `disk` plugin reloads root CA credentials on all CSR requests. If the
credentials cannot be loaded, then the previously loaded credentials will be used.
This provides two things: first, it ensures that the spire-server process does not
need to be restarted to load a new UpstreamCA from disk, providing a seamless rotation;
second, it ensures that a failed disk does not effect a running spire-server until the
loaded UpstreamCA expires.

The plugin accepts the following configuration options:

| Configuration  | Description                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ttl            | The TTL for issued certificates       |
| cert_file_path | Path to the "upstream" CA certificate |
| key_file_path  | Path to the "upstream" CA key file    |

Key files must contain a single PEM encoded key. The supported key types are EC (ASN.1 or PKCS8 encoded) or RSA (PKCS1 or PKCS8 encoded).

A sample configuration:

```
    UpstreamCA "disk" {
        plugin_data {
            ttl = "1h"
            cert_file_path = "conf/server/dummy_upstream_ca.crt"
            key_file_path = "conf/server/dummy_upstream_ca.key"
        }
    }
```

# Server plugin: UpstreamCA "disk"

The `disk` plugin loads root CA credentials from disk, using them to generate
intermediate signing certificates for the server's signing authority. The
intermediate certificates are minted against CSRs generated by the ServerCA
plugin.

The plugin accepts the following configuration options:

| Configuration  | Description                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ttl            | The TTL for issued certificates       |
| cert_file_path | Path to the "upstream" CA certificate |
| key_file_path  | Path to the "upstream" CA key file    |

Key files must contain a single PEM encoded key. The supported key types are EC (ASN.1 or PKCS8 encoded) or RSA (PKCS1 or PKCS8 encoded).

A sample configuration:

```
    UpstreamCA "disk" {
        plugin_data {
            ttl = "1h"
            cert_file_path = "conf/server/dummy_upstream_ca.crt"
            key_file_path = "conf/server/dummy_upstream_ca.key"
        }
    }
```
